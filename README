Much of the X and pseudoterminal code is borrowed from st (https://st.suckless.org/)
This probably complicates licensing, but fortunately I don't care :)

the goal is to match the behavior of xterm (minus some complex features that aren't used much)

I hope to perhaps add image support eventually, using the kitty graphics protocol.

Starting ~June 6th, i've been writing this terminal using itself (with emacs of course)


todo: ok so i renamed buffer1.h to buffer.h and got an error running make
one of the dependency files listed buffer1.h and it didn't realize nothing needed it
how to fix?
