Much of the X and pseudoterminal code is borrowed from st (https://st.suckless.org/)
This probably complicates licensing, but fortunately I don't care :)

the goal is to match the behavior of xterm (minus some complex features that aren't used much)

I hope to perhaps add image support eventually, using the kitty graphics protocol.

Starting ~June 6th, i've been writing this terminal using itself (with emacs of course)

# Notes

Note: "background color erase" is a controversial issue...
for now, my solution is:
1: bce is always enabled on the alternate screen
 - this is to improve compatibility and efficiency for 'graphical' programs, which run in the alternate screen
2: bce is enabled on the main screen, when using commands to scroll or insert/delete lines etc.
3: bce is DISABLED on the main screen, when printing newlines and when text wraps automatically.
 - this is so that, if a line break occurs in the middle of a highlighted region of text, it will not affect the background color of the new row.
 - I think I can get away with this, because it's rather uncommon to have large areas with custom background color on the main screen, so bce is rarely useful here.

todo: ok so i renamed buffer1.h to buffer.h and got an error running make
one of the dependency files listed buffer1.h and it didn't realize nothing needed it
how to fix?
